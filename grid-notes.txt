- To get the node modules folder from package.json file: sudo npm install

-  universal reset using *? Because that should get rid of unexpected paddings and margins, and especially of their differences between browsers.

- Steps:
	1. Analyze the no. of unique parts (8 column layout, in our case)
	2. Make a rough layout of these using grid
	3. Use only responsive units like %, vh, vw, min-content etc. NO PIXELS.

- NEW THINGS:
	1. extends (typography)
	2. modifiers (typography)
